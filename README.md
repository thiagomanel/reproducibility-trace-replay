# reproducibility-trace-replay
File system trace replay reproducibility.

In this project, we aim to know the effects of the difference between the performance of trace environment and replay environment. That is, how trace replayers (beefsrepl and artc) behave when they reproduce a trace in an environment that is different from the capture environment.
